### Pull Requests

If you'd like to contribute code, here’s how you can help:

1. **Fork the repository**: Create a personal fork of the project so you can make changes.
2. **Create a branch**: Create a new branch for your changes. For example:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```
3. **Make your changes**: Implement your changes, making sure to follow existing coding style and conventions.
4. **Commit your changes**: Write clear, concise commit messages that describe what you've done.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new feature: My new feature"
   ```
5. **Push your changes**: Push the branch to your fork.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature

6. **Open a pull request**: Submit a pull request with a description of your changes, and we will review it. Make sure your code is well-documented and tested.

### Code Style

- Use descriptive variable names and functions.
- Ensure your changes are well-tested (add new tests when appropriate).
- Keep commits focused and concise, ideally 1-2 features or fixes per commit.

### Testing

Make sure to test your changes locally before submitting a pull request. We aim for high-quality code, and testing is essential to ensure that changes don’t break existing functionality.
